# lddtest

Perform logarithmic density discontinuity (LDD) equivalence testing for regression discontinuity designs (RDD) in Python.

This package implements the methodologies by [Fitzgerald (2024)](https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/300277) and [McCrary (2008)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407607001133) in Python. It replicates the [Stata package of the same name](https://github.com/jack-fitzgerald/lddtest).
